Anyways, if you would like to know how i did this, here you go.

When an image was uploaded to exity.pics the files mimetype was checked,
for example 
image/gif
image/jpeg
image/png
etc,

this is pretty simple to exploit as all you have to do is create any file and add
GIF98a;

to the start and upload it,
this meant i could just add that to the start of a .php file and upload it bypassing the mimetype checks

so thats all there was to it :)
